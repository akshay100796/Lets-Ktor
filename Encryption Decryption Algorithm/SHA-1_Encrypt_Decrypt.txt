"SHA-1 is Single Way Encryption Algorithm hence you can encrypt text but cannot decrypt"




Refer File : Lets-Ktor / Encryption Decryption Algorithm / MD5_Encrypt_Decrypt.txt

You have to replace following line No 35 in MD5_Encrypt_Decrypt.txt
      
      if(messageDigest == null) messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")
      
With this following line     
    
      if(messageDigest == null) messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1")
 
 
 Rest is Everything same
